### Prompt

Can you plan a roadmap for us to build a MVP for a webapp based on the attached prompt (let's just plan out the steps so we can do them after I review them).

- Feel free to suggest anything you would need more clarification, or any opinions.
- Any references to any files insde the prompt consider the root of this project.

I'll help create a roadmap for building the Cross Clipboard MVP based on the provided prompt. Let me break this down into clear phases and highlight any areas where we might need clarification.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - Review and enhance existing `docker-compose.yml`
   - Verify MongoDB configuration and init scripts
   - Set up development environment with hot-reloading

2. **Client Scaffolding**
   - Create Vite + React + TypeScript project
   - Set up TailwindCSS
   - Configure development proxy for API communication
   - Establish project structure (components, hooks, utils)

3. **Server Foundation**
   - Structure Express application with TypeScript
   - Set up MongoDB connection with proper types
   - Implement basic error handling middleware
   - Add logging and monitoring basics

### Phase 2: Core Features - Backend
1. **Data Models**
   - Session schema (6-digit code, expiry, archived status)
   - Item schema (text/image content, deviceId, timestamps)
   - Implement model relationships and validation

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Session management (create, join, validate)
   - Item CRUD operations
   - Conflict detection system
   - Device authentication mechanism

### Phase 3: Core Features - Frontend
1. **Basic UI Components**
   - Session code display/input
   - Item list view
   - Text/image input toggle
   - Edit/delete controls
   - Basic responsive layout

2. **State Management**
   - Session context
   - Device ID management
   - Real-time updates handling
   - Error state handling

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Implement conflict detection UI
   - Resolution flow
   - Optimistic updates

2. **Session Management**
   - URL-based session joining
   - Session expiry handling
   - Device limit enforcement

3. **Polish & UX**
   - Loading states
   - Error feedback
   - Copy/paste interactions
   - Mobile responsiveness

### Areas Needing Clarification:
1. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Should we implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates between devices?
   - Or is polling sufficient for the MVP?

2. **Image Handling**:
   - Maximum image size limits?
   - Supported formats?
   - Storage strategy (Base64, S3, local storage)?

3. **Session Management**:
   - Should we implement a cleanup mechanism for expired sessions?
   - How should we handle device disconnection?

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Rate limiting strategy?
   - Content validation approach?
   - Any specific security measures needed beyond basic sanitization?

### Technical Decisions to Make:
1. **State Management**:
   - Context API vs Redux (given the scope, Context might be sufficient)
   - Real-time sync strategy

2. **Type System**:
   - Shared types between frontend and backend?
   - Schema validation approach (Zod, Joi, or similar?)

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit testing setup
   - Integration testing approach
   - E2E testing needs

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or would you prefer to start with a specific phase? Also, please let me know if you have any preferences or requirements regarding the technical decisions and clarifications mentioned above.
