### Prompt

all passing now, can you just briefly explain how this error handler middleware actually works inside express, and how jest's spyOn with that implemented can handle so much stuff - behind the scenes is just as the try/catch we had before but of course way more clean and properly separated;

# How Express Error Handler Middleware Works

Express error handling middleware is a special type of middleware that takes 4 parameters instead of the usual 3:

```typescript
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) { ... }
```

Here's how it works:

1. **Error Propagation**: When an error occurs in a route handler or middleware, Express looks for an error handling middleware (one with 4 parameters).

2. **Async Error Catching**: Our `asyncHandler` wrapper is key - it wraps route handlers in a Promise and uses `.catch(next)` to forward any errors to Express's error handling system.

3. **Registration Order**: Error handling middleware must be registered after all routes and regular middleware, which is why we added it last in both our main app and test setup.

4. **Error Processing**: Our error handler checks the error's type using `instanceof` and sends an appropriate HTTP status code and response based on the error class.

# How Jest's spyOn Works With This System

Jest's `spyOn` allows us to:

1. **Monitor Function Calls**: We can spy on methods like `dataService.createSession()` to see if they're called.

2. **Mock Error Responses**: We can force functions to throw specific errors without changing the implementation:
   ```typescript
   jest.spyOn(dataService, 'getSessionByCode').mockRejectedValueOnce(
     new SessionNotFoundError('123456', 'code')
   );
   ```

3. **Clean Isolation**: Each test runs with fresh mocks thanks to `jest.restoreAllMocks()` in the `afterEach` hook.

The combination of Express error middleware and Jest mocking creates a cleaner architecture where:
- Route handlers focus on happy paths
- Error handling is centralized
- Tests can simulate various error scenarios
- Code is more maintainable and DRY

This pattern is much more maintainable than embedding try/catch blocks in every route handler.

Ok, while on it, why did you use multiple `if`s at @errorHandler() instead of a `switch`? please elaborate the reasons since I'd always go for the `switch` when more than 3 if s with returns.

### Reply

Good question! Here's why I used multiple `if` statements instead of a `switch` in the error handler:

1. **Type checking with `instanceof`**: The primary reason is that `instanceof` checks don't work well with `switch` statements. A `switch` compares values directly for equality, but we need to check if an error is an *instance* of various error classes.

2. **Inheritance hierarchy**: Error types can have an inheritance relationship (like `SessionArchivedException` extends `SessionError`). The `if (err instanceof SessionNotFoundError || err instanceof SessionArchivedException)` pattern lets us group related error types easily with an OR condition.

3. **More flexible conditions**: `if` statements allow for combining multiple conditions (like checking both the error type and its properties) which can be useful for error handling.

4. **Code clarity**: Each block clearly shows what error type is being handled and how, making it easy to update or extend.

You could theoretically use a `switch` with the error's constructor name:

```typescript
switch(err.constructor.name) {
  case 'SessionNotFoundError':
  case 'SessionArchivedException':
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Session not found' });
  // other cases...
}
```

But this approach is more brittle - it breaks with code minification, and doesn't respect the inheritance hierarchy of errors.

In this specific case, the `if` approach is more appropriate despite having more than 3 conditions.
