### Agent (cont.)

Before we added localization, we were discussing the implementation of the server API and MongoDB integration, as you mentioned it would be needed to properly test the conflict resolution functionality since our current sessions aren't persisted.

You specifically said:
> since we'll need to have the basic of server API + its mongo db working to test conflicts - since our current sessions aren't persisted - our deviceId logic would make the mock of sessions even more complex

So our next phase would be:
1. Implementing the server API with proper session persistence
2. Setting up MongoDB integration
3. Converting our mock service to use the real API
4. Testing the conflict resolution in a real multi-device scenario

Would you like to proceed with the server-side implementation? We can start by:
1. Setting up the Express.js server structure
2. Defining the MongoDB schema for sessions and items
3. Implementing the basic API endpoints that match our current mock service interface
4. Adding proper error handling and validation

Let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle first.

### Prompt

Ok, let's go with this plan for the next phase. Some notes:
- we can completely ignore the docker containers setup for now, just leave the current @docker-compose.yml and each module's Dockerfile as they are;
- like said before, feel free to change everything else about the codebase on the server module/dir, for now I will not use docker, just plain node to run the server, but use at least the port we have defined in the docker config.
- please try to be as modular and parameterized as possible, avoid huge procedural-like files and code as much as possible, prioritize to separate concerns, even though it is a simple system; if any "utility-like" functionalities, I rather have a separate Util service than inside the code of a route, for example;
- feel free to either already implement Joi for validation or just to stub or placehold that validation before we acutally confirm core functionality;
- use the most specific http response codes where possible, like for example 409 for conflict, etc;

for now, let's go with only step 1 and mock data with mongodb-like documents in json files, let's try to do it just like we did it in client, but this time reading and writing in json files. this will allow us to test the first implemented functionalities through simple node process without the actual mongodb storage for now.

Let me know what do you think about this strategy before proceeding, feel free to give any opinions and suggestions.

Your strategy sounds solid and aligns well with good software development practices. Here's my take on the approach, with some suggestions:

1. **Server Structure**:
```
server/
├── src/
│   ├── config/           # Configuration management
│   ├── controllers/      # Route handlers
│   ├── middleware/       # Custom middleware
│   ├── models/          # Data models/types
│   ├── routes/          # Route definitions
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   │   ├── session/     # Session-related operations
│   │   ├── storage/     # Storage abstraction (file-based for now, MongoDB later)
│   │   └── utils/       # Utility services
│   ├── types/           # TypeScript types/interfaces
│   └── app.js           # Express app setup
```

2. **Key Aspects**:
- Storage Abstraction: Create a storage service interface that can be implemented by both file-based and MongoDB storage later
- Clear separation between routes, controllers, and services
- Centralized error handling with custom error classes
- Validation schemas separate from routes/controllers

3. **Initial Implementation Strategy**:
```typescript
// Example storage interface
interface StorageService {
  getSessions(): Promise<Session[]>;
  getSession(id: string): Promise<Session>;
  createSession(data: SessionCreate): Promise<Session>;
  // ... other methods
}

// File-based implementation
class FileStorageService implements StorageService {
  private dataPath: string;
  
  constructor(dataPath: string) {
    this.dataPath = dataPath;
  }
  
  // Implementation using JSON files
}

// Later MongoDB implementation
class MongoStorageService implements StorageService {
  // MongoDB implementation
}
```

4. **Error Handling**:
```typescript
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    public statusCode: number,
    message: string,
    public details?: any
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}

// Usage examples
throw new ApiError(409, 'Content conflict detected', { version: currentVersion });
throw new ApiError(404, 'Session not found');
```

5. **File Storage Strategy**:
- Keep separate JSON files for sessions and items
- Implement file locking for concurrent writes
- Use atomic write operations (write to temp file, then rename)
- Maintain an in-memory cache with periodic flush to disk

Benefits of this approach:
1. Easy to test without database dependencies
2. Clear path to MongoDB migration
3. Modular and maintainable code structure
4. Type safety with TypeScript
5. Easy to add new storage implementations
6. Testable business logic separate from storage

Would you like me to proceed with this approach? I can start with:
1. Setting up the basic Express server with TypeScript
2. Implementing the storage service interface and file-based implementation
3. Creating the initial routes and controllers
4. Adding basic validation schemas

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to this plan or if you have specific preferences for any part of the implementation.
