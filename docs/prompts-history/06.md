### Prompt

Great implementation, but again, whenever you cannot read or write a global ignored file please just ask me to do it, showing the intended content to be added/modifying. But no sweat in here, it's handled.

Now for the bug we're getting from the client requests for sessions routes including `:id` in its url, it's sending the actual CODE, not the id of the session. Which is the wanted behavior from the client really, since the code is also unique and we want everything - so far - related to sessions requests from the client to only be aware of its code.

This is also a question if you think this is the best practice indeed, to use that session code and not its "data service id", which after all will be used only for consistency interanlly in the server system. If so, do you think it is secure to always assume that any requests with a session :id to the server is its `code`? - and if so let's change in our current routes since it seems all of them are assuming it is the session service id, not the code property.

You're right about the sessions routes issue. Using the session code for client interactions is actually a good practice rather than exposing internal IDs. Let me analyze this and suggest changes.

Using the session code rather than internal IDs offers several benefits:
1. It hides implementation details from clients
2. It provides a more user-friendly identifier
3. It adds a layer of security by not exposing internal database IDs

Let's check the current session routes implementation:

Read file: server/src/routes/session.ts
Now let's check the data service implementation to understand how sessions and codes are related:

Read file: server/src/types/index.ts
Let's check the mock data service implementation to see how it handles codes vs IDs:

Read file: server/src/services/mockDataService.ts
Based on the code review, I recommend modifying the routes to use session codes instead of IDs. Here's my implementation plan:


I've updated the session routes to use codes instead of internal IDs for all API endpoints. Here's what's changed:

1. All routes now expect a session code in URLs instead of an internal ID (`:id` â†’ `:code`)

2. The implementation pattern is now:
   - Use `getSessionByCode()` to find the session by its public code
   - Then use the session's internal ID for any data service operations
   - Handle `SessionNotFoundError` explicitly to return 404 status

3. Error handling is improved to distinguish between:
   - Session not found (404)
   - Item not found (404)
   - Database errors (503)
   - Other server errors (500)

This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Security improvement**: Internal database IDs aren't exposed through the API
2. **User experience**: Session codes are shorter and easier to share
3. **Consistency**: All client interactions use the same session identifier
4. **Clean abstraction**: The internal implementation details (UUIDs) are hidden from API consumers

Using session codes as the primary identifier in the API is absolutely a best practice. It follows the principle of "never expose database IDs" and provides a clean abstraction boundary between your internal implementation and the public API. The session code serves as both a security mechanism (making sessions harder to guess) and a user-friendly identifier.

The implementation is secure because:
1. Each request now validates that the code exists
2. The code is checked against the database before any operation
3. Error handling is explicit and doesn't leak information

The client can continue to work with session codes exclusively, and the server handles the mapping to internal IDs. This provides a clean separation of concerns and a more robust API design.
