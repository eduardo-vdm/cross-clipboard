### Areas Needing Clarification:
1. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Should we implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates between devices?
   > Yes  but not for the MVP, keep it simple and open to change and implement through websockets;
   - Or is polling sufficient for the MVP?   
   > Yes, polling is sufficient for the MVP;

2. **Image Handling**:
   - Maximum image size limits?
   > 10MB for now, but we can change it to 50MB or 100MB later; make sure to handle the size limit in the backend; make sure to make it parameterizable the easiest way;
   - Supported formats?
   > PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG
   - Storage strategy (Base64, S3, local storage)?
   > Base64 for now, but we can change it to S3 or local storage later;

3. **Session Management**:
   - Should we implement a cleanup mechanism for expired sessions?
   > For now, we should not delete sessions, make it more like "archived" sessions only for the MVP like a "trash" folder, more for backup purposes;
   - How should we handle device disconnection?
   > We should handle device disconnection by leaving it a 24h window to reconnect and if not, we should archive the session as mentioned above;

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Rate limiting strategy?
   > We should implement rate limiting for the API; basic captcha for the MVP client, not too strict though but enough to prevent abuse; let's keep it simple and parameterizable;
   - Content validation approach?
   > We should implement content validation for the API; try to use the best practices for the best security, but using a popular and well-supported library, prefereably an express middleware;
   - Any specific security measures needed beyond basic sanitization?
   > We should implement security measures for the API, but not too complex for the MVP, the ideal is to have a basic security measures for the MVP and then add more complex security measures later;

### Technical Decisions to Make:
1. **State Management**:
   - Context API vs Redux (given the scope, Context might be sufficient)
   > We should use the Context API for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement Redux later if needed;
   - Real-time sync strategy
   > We should implement real-time sync for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement WebSocket later if needed;

2. **Type System**:
   - Shared types between frontend and backend?
   > We are not using typescript, only vanilla javascript for the MVP, so no need for shared types between frontend and backend;
   - Schema validation approach (Zod, Joi, or similar?)
   > Joi would be the best option for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement Zod later if needed; keep it simple and parameterizable;

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit testing setup
   > We should implement unit testing for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement Jest later if needed;
   - Integration testing approach
   > We should implement integration testing for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement Jest later if needed;
   - E2E testing needs
   > We should implement E2E testing for the MVP, but we should keep it open to change and implement Jest later if needed;


Let me know if you need more clarification on any of the points or additional information.







Some notes about this plan in case you see it's needed to be included:

- remember some very base stuff is already there so we don't have misconfigurations, mainly the docker containers, try to make it as close as possible as what we already have.

- the very basic of 'server/' is there only to make sure we have properly modularized routes, but since we're also adding a lot of features feel free to wipe the current code there, but make sure it follows the already setup container config, and the also already configured mongo container.

- both client and server will be in vanilla javascript for the mvp, it can be refactored later if possible.

please rewrite the plan with those changes in mind 





---

I'll revise the roadmap taking into account the existing infrastructure and vanilla JavaScript requirement. Here's the adjusted plan:

### Phase 1: Build Upon Existing Infrastructure
1. **Review & Enhance Docker Setup**
   - Verify existing containers (client, server, mongodb) configuration
   - Confirm environment variables (like `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001`)
   - Ensure development workflow with hot-reloading works

2. **Client Setup**
   - Create new Vite + React project (vanilla JavaScript)
   - Add TailwindCSS to existing configuration
   - Set up project structure:
     ```
     client/
     ├── src/
     │   ├── components/
     │   ├── contexts/
     │   ├── utils/
     │   └── App.jsx
     ```

3. **Server Restructuring**
   - Keep existing modular route structure but reorganize as:
     ```
     server/
     ├── routes/
     │   ├── session.js
     │   └── items.js
     ├── middleware/
     │   ├── validation.js
     │   ├── rateLimit.js
     │   └── security.js
     ├── models/
     │   ├── session.js
     │   └── item.js
     └── index.js
     ```

### Phase 2: Core Backend Implementation
1. **Data Models**
   - Session model:
     - 6-digit code
     - Archive flag
     - Device tracking
     - Expiry handling
   - Item model:
     - Content (text/Base64 image)
     - Device ownership
     - Timestamps

2. **API Routes**
   - Session management:
     - Create/join sessions
     - Archive handling
     - Device validation
   - Item operations:
     - CRUD endpoints
     - Image validation (10MB limit, supported formats)
     - Polling endpoint for updates

3. **Middleware Setup**
   - Joi validation schemas
   - Basic rate limiting
   - Content validation
   - Error handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Core Features
1. **State Management**
   - Context setup for:
     - Session state
     - Device ID
     - Items list
     - Error handling

2. **Main Components**
   - Session management:
     - Code display/input
     - Join/create flow
   - Item handling:
     - Text/image input toggle
     - List view
     - Edit/delete controls
   - Polling implementation

3. **UI Implementation**
   - Basic responsive layout
   - Image upload/preview
   - Error messages
   - Loading states

### Phase 4: MVP Completion
1. **Security & Validation**
   - Basic captcha
   - Content sanitization
   - Error boundary implementation
   - Rate limit handling

2. **Polish & Testing**
   - Basic unit tests
   - Simple integration tests
   - UX improvements:
     - Copy/paste functionality
     - Loading indicators
     - Error feedback

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. **Major Improvements**
   - WebSocket implementation
   - TypeScript migration
   - S3/local storage for images
   - Enhanced security

2. **Technical Debt**
   - Code refactoring
   - Performance optimization
   - Advanced testing coverage
   - Documentation

Would you like to start with Phase 1? We can begin by reviewing the existing Docker setup and then move on to the client scaffolding. Also, I can provide more detailed specifications for any of these phases if needed.

The key differences in this revised plan are:
- Acknowledges and builds upon existing Docker configuration
- Maintains the current modular route structure in the server
- Stays with vanilla JavaScript
- Focuses on extending rather than replacing existing infrastructure
- More specific about file structure and organization
