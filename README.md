# Cross-Clipboard

A web application that allows users to share clipboard items across multiple devices using simple 6-digit session codes.

## Motivation

This portfolio project demonstrates a practical use case while showcasing technical versatility through an intentional mix of technologies:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite
- **Backend**: TypeScript with Node.js/Express

The deliberate combination of typed (backend) and untyped (frontend) code creates an interesting development workflow that reflects real-world scenarios where developers must adapt to different code environments. While standardizing on a single approach would be preferable in production, this hybrid approach serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of technical adaptability.

The application itself solves a common problem - sharing clipboard content between devices - with a simple, accessible interface using 6-digit session codes.
