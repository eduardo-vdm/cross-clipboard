# üìã Cross Clipboard ‚Äî Developer Context & Changelog

## ‚úÖ Project Summary

Cross Clipboard is a web app to **share clipboard content** (text, rich text, images, and files) between devices using a 6-digit numeric session code. It is designed for:

- Personal productivity (user copying content across browser/devices)
- MVP-first simplicity
- Dockerized local development and optional cloud deployment
- Being a showcase of full-stack, containerized app development

---

## üß± Tech Stack Overview

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (local container per project)
- **Dev Environment:** Docker Compose
- **Clipboard Sharing:** Based on short-lived 6-digit session codes
- **Conflict Handling:** Soft-lock system with per-device awareness

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Docker Compose services:
- `client`: Vite dev server with TailwindCSS and `.env` API URL
- `server`: Express backend with routes mounted under `/api`
- `mongodb`: Mongo 6 container with named volume persistence

### MongoDB Configuration:
- Initialized using `mongo-init.js` to create:
  - DB: `cross_clipboard`
  - App user: `crossclip_app / clip123secure`
- Logging suppressed using `mongod.conf`

---

## üöÄ Implemented So Far

### Backend

- **`POST /api/session`**: generates new 6-digit code and session entry
- **`POST /api/session/:code`**: stores or updates content (text for now)
  - Tracks `updatedAt`, `lastUpdatedBy`, and optional `deviceId`
  - Implements a **soft conflict timeout**: 5s window blocking other writers
- **`GET /api/session/:code`**: retrieves latest content for a session

### Frontend

- Vite app runs with `host: true` for Docker access (`localhost:5173`)
- Tailwind configured
- Only scaffolded App.jsx for now (UI not started)

---

## üîê Conflict Resolution Model (MVP-friendly)

- Last writer tracked with `lastUpdatedBy` and `updatedAt`
- Soft lock: warns or blocks overwrite if updated < 5s ago by another `deviceId`
- Polling/WebSocket TBD later
- No strict locking to keep UX lightweight

---

## ‚úÖ Dev Environment Notes

- Containers built and connected via `docker-compose`
- Mongo data persists via `crossclip_mongo_data` volume
- Clipboard sync features being built incrementally (text first)
- Seeding handled via manual `npm run seed` inside server container

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Suggested Next Steps

1. Implement frontend input to submit clipboard content (POST `/session`)
2. Display generated code for sharing
3. Add input to retrieve content using a code (GET `/session`)
4. Save `deviceId` in `localStorage` for basic conflict detection
5. Add loading states + error messages for 409 conflicts
